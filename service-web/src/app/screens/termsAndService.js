                                Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and your Claim may
                                not be consolidated with any other person’s claim. You and we agree that
                                the U.K. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement
                                of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a
                                trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Section 11 shall

                                to you (“<strong>Notice</strong>“). Your Notice must (1) be sent by
                                certified mail; (2) be addressed to: Legal Department, Buscador.co.uk, 62
                                Shenstone Road, Great Barr, Birmingham, B43 5LN ; (3) describe the nature
                                of your Claim; and (4) specify the damages or other relief you seek. If we

                                Notice is received, either you or we may commence an arbitration or file a

                                not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms, including

                                the entire agreement between you and us and supersede all prior agreements
                                with respect to the subject matter hereof. Nothing in these Terms affects

                                Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law,
