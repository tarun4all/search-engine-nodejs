                                out of or relating to the Services or these Terms (a “    <strong>Claim</strong>”), and the Claim is not resolved by contacting our

                                we each agree to resolve such Claim through an individual binding
                                arbitration or through an individual action in small claims court in the
                                U.K. county (or parish) of your residence or in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
                                Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and your Claim may
                                not be consolidated with any other person’s claim. You and we agree that
                                the U.K. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement
                                of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a
                                trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Section 11 shall
                                survive termination of these Terms or any subscription that you may have to

                                written notice of your claim or we must send a written notice of our claim
                                to you (“<strong>Notice</strong>“). Your Notice must (1) be sent by
                                certified mail; (2) be addressed to: Legal Department, Buscador.co.uk, 62
                                Shenstone Road, Great Barr, Birmingham, B43 5LN ; (3) describe the nature
                                of your Claim; and (4) specify the damages or other relief you seek. If we
                                and you do not then resolve the Claim within 30 days after our receipt of
                                Notice is received, either you or we may commence an arbitration or file a
                                small claims court action to resolve the Claim.

                                not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms, including
                                all additional terms, conditions, and policies on the Services, constitute
                                the entire agreement between you and us and supersede all prior agreements
                                with respect to the subject matter hereof. Nothing in these Terms affects
                                any non-waivable statutory rights that apply to you. If any part of these
                                Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law,
                                that provision will be removed, and the remainder of the Terms will
                                continue to be valid and enforceable.
