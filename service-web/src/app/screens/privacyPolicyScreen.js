                                We will update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in
                                our practices and service offerings. If we modify our Privacy Policy, we
                                will update the “Last Modified Date” at the top of this Privacy Policy and
                                such changes will be effective upon posting. If we make any material
                                changes to the way we use personal information we collect, we will notify
                                you in advance by email through the email address you most recently
                                provided to us or by prominently posting a prominent notice of the changes
                                on the Biscador.com Services. We will not use information we have already
                                collected in a different way than we have described here, without your
                                consent.
